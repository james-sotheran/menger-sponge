# menger-sponge

Menger sponge using Python and Matplotlib 3D

Requirements: matplotlib, numpy

Things to improve:
 - Could use a better final iteration process, such as iteration with each button press.
 - It is pretty laggy once past iteration2, you can remove comments in menger function to try iteration3.
 - Hard to see what the sponge looks like in wireframe or full surfaces
